# README

The main HydraDX model can be found in "hydradx".

Installation: 
* Install Python 3.9. Not 3.8, it doesn't support all the features used in this code. Not 3.10, there is a compatibility issue with one of the libraries that you don't want to deal with. Link: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3912/
* Clone the repository and navigate to the root folder, HydraDx-simulations
* In terminal, enter 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
* Alternatively, open the project folder in PyCharm, and you'll be prompted to create a virtual environment for this project.
